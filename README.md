The goal of this project is to create an OS X driver for those Intel WiFi cards 

## Supported Hardware
The following Intel WiFi cards/chips are supported:

## Driver Status
Initial Commit of BSD code. (SEE Wiki For More Details).    
I will be working on this project over week ends. It has 
low importance for me right now.

## Credits

In building this driver, I'm relying on:
* The iwm driver from FreeBSD
